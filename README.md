# Project Title

Pipeline for RNA-Sequencing Data Analysis(PRADA2)

# Description

Massively parallel sequencing of cDNA reverse transcribed from RNA (RNASeq) provides an accurate estimate of the quantity and composition of mRNAs. To characterize the transcriptome through the analysis of RNA-seq data, we developed PRADA. PRADA focuses on the processing and analysis of gene expression estimates, supervised and unsupervised gene fusion identification, and supervised intragenic deletion identification. The BAM files generated by the pipeline are readily compatible with different tools for mutation calling and to obtain read counts for further downstream analysis.

# Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
