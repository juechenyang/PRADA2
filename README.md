# PRADA2

Description

Massively parallel sequencing of cDNA reverse transcribed from RNA (RNASeq) provides an accurate estimate of the quantity and composition of mRNAs. To characterize the transcriptome through the analysis of RNA-seq data, we developed PRADA. PRADA focuses on the processing and analysis of gene expression estimates, supervised and unsupervised gene fusion identification, and supervised intragenic deletion identification. The BAM files generated by the pipeline are readily compatible with different tools for mutation calling and to obtain read counts for further downstream analysis.
